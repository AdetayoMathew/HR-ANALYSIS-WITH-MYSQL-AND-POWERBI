The project will utilize data from InnovateTech Solutions' HR database, encompassing information such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, job titles, locations, tenure, and termination records. Ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of the data will be a top priority throughout the analysis.

The key stakeholders for this project include the HR management team, department heads, and senior executives at InnovateTech Solutions, who are responsible for shaping HR strategies and initiatives. The findings of this analysis will provide valuable insights to support evidence-based decision-making in areas such as diversity and inclusion, talent management, and employee retention.

By conducting this comprehensive analysis, we aim to contribute to InnovateTech Solutions' ongoing efforts to optimize its HR practices, foster a diverse and inclusive workforce, and create a thriving work environment where employees can reach their full potential.
